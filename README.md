# Ionic How To Template

The purpose of this project is to show you how to `do` things in Ionic. A lot of plugins, or functionality require 
tricks that aren't widely known - or take hours of Googling, debugging that could be spent making your app look or 
act better.

This is not meant to be a starter template in the sense that It will not look like a polished app aesthetically. 
Purely, it's purpose is to be functionally full - with theming being pushed to the wayside.

The structure of this project is purely subjective, and what I prefer to do in larger applications.
